My dad requested I make a tile calcualtor for him. He does contracting work, as I have done with him before, so I have a general idea on what inputs the data needs and what output he wants to read. 
He is not the most tech-savvy, he owned a flip phone for about 15 years, so eventually I wish to learn HTML and be able to make this software easier for him to understand
